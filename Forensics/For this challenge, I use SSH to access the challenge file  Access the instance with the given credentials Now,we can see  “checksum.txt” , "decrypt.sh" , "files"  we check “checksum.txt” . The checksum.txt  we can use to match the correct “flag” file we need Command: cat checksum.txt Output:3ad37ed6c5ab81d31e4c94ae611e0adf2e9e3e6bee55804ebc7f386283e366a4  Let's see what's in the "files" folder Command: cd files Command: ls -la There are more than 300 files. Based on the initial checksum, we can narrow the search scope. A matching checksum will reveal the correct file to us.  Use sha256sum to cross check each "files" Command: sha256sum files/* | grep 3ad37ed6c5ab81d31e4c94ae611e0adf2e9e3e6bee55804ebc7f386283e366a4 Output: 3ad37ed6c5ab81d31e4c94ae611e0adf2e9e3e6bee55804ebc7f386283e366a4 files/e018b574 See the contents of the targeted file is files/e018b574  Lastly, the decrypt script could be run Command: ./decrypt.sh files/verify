For this challenge, I use SSH to access the challenge file

Access the instance with the given credentials
Now,we can see  “checksum.txt” , "decrypt.sh" , "files"

we check “checksum.txt” . The checksum.txt  we can use to match the correct “flag” file we need
Command: cat checksum.txt
Output:3ad37ed6c5ab81d31e4c94ae611e0adf2e9e3e6bee55804ebc7f386283e366a4

Let's see what's in the "files" folder
Command: cd files
Command: ls -la
There are more than 300 files. Based on the initial checksum, we can narrow the search scope. A matching checksum will reveal the correct file to us.

Use sha256sum to cross check each "files"
Command: sha256sum files/* | grep 3ad37ed6c5ab81d31e4c94ae611e0adf2e9e3e6bee55804ebc7f386283e366a4
Output: 3ad37ed6c5ab81d31e4c94ae611e0adf2e9e3e6bee55804ebc7f386283e366a4 files/e018b574
See the contents of the targeted file is files/e018b574

Lastly, the decrypt script could be run
Command: ./decrypt.sh files/e018b574

The flag is picoCTF{trust_but_verify_e018b574}
